# BlogTemplate
just a crappy template for a blog, very bare bones, just standard html with angular 1.5

It's not particularly useful at the moment. My goal is to eventually get it to where you just add styling once,
then from that point on you only have to add content to the posts.json file to add a new post. 

Be weary of spelling errors, I tend to get sloppy at night when I build little things like this.
